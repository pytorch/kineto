# IPC Fabric

IPC Fabric provides simple inter-process communication primitive that
leverages Linux named sockets. It supports point-point communication
between multiple processes.

## Why we added?
The fabric can be used to register/trigger trace collection remotely
using a companion daemon process. We are in the process of open
sourcing this daemon.

## Caveat
These files are a placeholder till we move the ipcfabric into a
different open source repo. At this point this component will become
a submodule dependency.
